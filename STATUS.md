# HorizonOS Build Status

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Script Permissions
- All scripts are now executable
- Fixed path issues in scripts due to nested directories

### 2. OSTree Repository
- OSTree repository exists and has a test commit
- Commit ID: 97cea14f7de158506f6e04011a69300da6c3b52ea12d415ece55a06bbd072ec8

### 3. ISO Build Script
- Fixed PROJECT_ROOT paths in all scripts
- Added `arch-install-scripts` package for arch-chroot
- Improved installer script to handle OSTree deployments
- Fixed GRUB installation for UEFI systems
- Created OSTree-aware GRUB configuration helper

### 4. Kotlin DSL
- Reorganized source files to correct directory structure
- Created build.gradle.kts with all dependencies
- Set up Gradle wrapper files
- Example configuration exists at `src/kotlin-config/examples/desktop.horizonos.kts`
- Core DSL implementation is complete with:
  - System configuration
  - Package management
  - Service management
  - User management
  - Repository configuration (including OSTree)

## üöÄ Ready to Build

### Build the ISO:
```bash
sudo ./scripts/scripts/build-iso.sh
```

### Test the Kotlin DSL:
```bash
cd src/kotlin-config
./gradlew build
./gradlew compileConfig -PconfigFile=examples/desktop.horizonos.kts
```

### Test the ISO in QEMU:
```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 4G -enable-kvm -cdrom build/out/horizonos-*.iso
```

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Build and test the ISO** - Run the build command with sudo
2. **Test boot in QEMU** - Verify the ISO boots correctly
3. **Test the installer** - Run `horizonos-install` in the live environment
4. **Complete Kotlin DSL integration** - The compiler currently has placeholder implementation for actual script execution
5. **Add more system packages** - The current package list is minimal

## Known Issues to Watch For

1. The Kotlin DSL compiler needs proper script execution implementation
2. OSTree GRUB configuration may need tweaking for proper boot
3. The installer may need adjustments based on testing results

The build system is now ready for testing!
