# HorizonOS Boot Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Getty TTY1 Loop with Flashing
**Problem**: The ISO was stuck in a loop at "Started Getty on tty1" with the HorizonOS ASCII art flashing repeatedly.

**Root Cause**: archiso uses `/sbin/agetty` but modern Arch systems have agetty at `/usr/bin/agetty`.

**Fix**: 
- Created comprehensive getty fix in `scripts/scripts/boot-fixes/getty-autologin.sh`
- Corrected agetty path to `/usr/bin/agetty`
- Added restart protection with `Restart=no`
- Added start limit protection with `StartLimitInterval=60s` and `StartLimitBurst=3`
- Masked extra TTYs (tty2-6) to prevent conflicts

### 2. Hanging at "Reached Graphical Interface"
**Problem**: After fixing getty, the ISO would hang at "Reached graphical interface" message.

**Root Cause**: archiso was defaulting to graphical.target but no graphical environment was installed.

**Fix**:
- Set `multi-user.target` as the default systemd target
- Added `systemd.unit=multi-user.target` to all boot methods:
  - GRUB configuration for UEFI
  - syslinux configuration for BIOS  
  - systemd-boot entries
- Ensured all systemd services use multi-user.target instead of graphical.target

## Testing Infrastructure

### Local Tests Created
1. **test-getty-locally.sh** - Tests getty configuration without building ISO
2. **test-getty-boot-simulation.sh** - Simulates systemd boot process
3. **test-getty-flashing.sh** - Specifically tests for conditions causing flashing
4. **test-full-boot-process.sh** - Comprehensive boot configuration verification
5. **test-iso-boot-qemu.sh** - Automated QEMU boot test with timeout

### What the Tests Verify
- Correct agetty path configuration
- Proper autologin setup for root
- Restart protection to prevent loops
- Default systemd target is multi-user
- Boot parameters include systemd.unit=multi-user.target
- No graphical packages that might trigger graphical.target
- Complete boot sequence to live environment

## Boot Sequence
The fixed boot sequence is now:
1. Kernel boots with `systemd.unit=multi-user.target` parameter
2. systemd starts and targets multi-user.target (text mode)
3. getty@tty1.service starts with autologin for root
4. Root shell appears automatically
5. MOTD displays "Welcome to HorizonOS Live"

## File Locations
- Getty fix: `scripts/scripts/boot-fixes/getty-autologin.sh`
- ISO build script: `scripts/scripts/build-iso.sh`
- Test scripts: `scripts/tests/test-*.sh`

## GitHub Actions
The workflow has been updated to include the boot fixes and will automatically build ISOs with these corrections applied.
