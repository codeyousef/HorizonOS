# [[HorizonOS]] Graph Desktop Design Document

## Executive Summary

The HorizonOS Graph Desktop represents a revolutionary departure from traditional hierarchical file systems and desktop metaphors. Instead of folders and windows, everything in the system exists as interconnected nodes in a 3D semantic graph space. This paradigm shift eliminates the "where did I save that file?" problem and provides natural representation of modern interconnected workflows.

## Core Philosophy

### Everything as Nodes

- **Files, applications, people, tasks, devices, and AI agents** exist as interconnected nodes
- **Semantic relationships** replace hierarchical folder structures
- **Visual navigation** through information landscapes
- **Context-aware workspaces** that adapt to current tasks

### Design Principles

1. **Familiar Visual Elements** - Apps show their actual icons, files show recognizable type icons
2. **Revolutionary Structure** - Semantic relationships, spatial organization, no hierarchical folders
3. **Natural Grouping** - Soft boundaries and clustering based on relationships
4. **Progressive Disclosure** - Complexity revealed gradually based on user comfort
5. **Intuitive Interaction** - Combines modern UX patterns with 3D navigation

## Data Architecture

### Node Structure

```typescript
interface Node {
    id: UUID;
    type: NodeType;
    properties: Map<string, any>;
    created: Timestamp;
    modified: Timestamp;
    permissions: Permissions;
}

enum NodeType {
    FILE, APPLICATION, PERSON, TASK, 
    DEVICE, AI_AGENT, AUTOMATION, URL,
    SETTING, CONFIG_GROUP
}
```

### Edge Structure

```typescript
interface Edge {
    id: UUID;
    source: UUID;
    target: UUID;
    type: RelationType;
    weight: number;
    properties: Map<string, any>;
}

enum RelationType {
    CONTAINS, DEPENDS_ON, CREATED_BY,
    RELATED_TO, TRIGGERS, MONITORS,
    CONFIGURES, REQUIRES
}
```

## Visual Design System

### Node Representation

- **Applications**: Display actual app icons (Chrome, VS Code, Photoshop, etc.)
- **Documents**: Show file type icons (PDF icon, Word icon, image thumbnails)
- **People**: Profile pictures when available, generic person icon otherwise
- **System Elements**: Standard system icons (gear for settings, CPU icon for monitoring)
- **Clustering**: Related items naturally group with soft glowing boundaries

### Relationship Visualization

- **Connection Lines**: Different colors and styles for relationship types
    - **Green flowing lines**: Data flow connections
    - **White/gray lines**: General relationships (thickness indicates strength)
    - **Red warning lines**: Conflicts or issues
    - **Blue dotted lines**: Temporary or suggested connections
- **Boundaries**: Soft, breathing perimeters around clusters
    - **Semi-transparent volumes**: Like soap bubbles containing related items
    - **Particle clouds**: Tiny floating particles creating implied boundaries
    - **Multi-membership**: Items can exist at intersection of multiple clusters

### 3D Spatial Organization

- **Depth-based Priority**: Recent/active items float closer to foreground
- **Semantic Zoom**: Different detail levels based on distance and focus
- **Focus+Context**: Sharp central items with atmospheric perspective for distant ones
- **Hardware-accelerated Rendering**: WebGPU/OpenGL for smooth 60fps interactions

## Interaction Design

### Navigation Paradigms

1. **3D Spatial Navigation** - Default mode for exploration and discovery
2. **Flatten Mode** - 2D overhead view for precision operations (drag-and-drop)
3. **Focus Zoom** - Bring distant clusters forward for local interaction
4. **Smart Search** - Natural language queries across all data types

### Core Interactions

#### Drag and Drop Operations

**Problem**: 3D dragging from background to foreground is problematic

**Solution**: Hybrid approach combining multiple interaction methods:

- **Auto-Flatten Trigger**: Starting any drag offers "Press space for overview"
- **Bring Forward**: Right-click distant item → "Bring to foreground"
- **Smart Magnetics**: Target clusters light up and extend connection previews
- **Context Menus**: Right-click → "Add to..." with visual cluster previews

#### Relationship Management

- **Visual Connection Drawing**: Draw lines between nodes to create relationships
- **Drag-to-Connect**: Drag item near cluster boundary for "Add to..." tooltip
- **Semantic Suggestions**: AI suggests potential relationships with preview
- **Multi-Select Operations**: Select multiple items for batch relationship creation

#### Cluster Management

- **Natural Grouping**: Items automatically cluster based on usage patterns
- **Manual Clustering**: Create custom clusters with drag-and-drop
- **Boundary Adjustment**: Resize and reshape cluster boundaries
- **Smart Suggestions**: "I notice these 47 photos were taken in same location - create cluster?"

### Gesture Support

- **Multi-touch Gestures**: Pinch-zoom, rotation, two-finger navigation
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility for power users
- **Voice Control**: Optional voice commands for accessibility
- **Eye Tracking**: Future support for gaze-based interaction

## Technical Implementation

### Rendering Engine

```kotlin
var renderingEngine: RenderingEngine = RenderingEngine.WEBGPU
var enablePhysics: Boolean = true
var maxNodes: Int = 10000
var maxEdges: Int = 50000
var performanceMode: PerformanceMode = PerformanceMode.BALANCED
```

**Supported Engines**:

- **WebGPU**: Primary high-performance engine
- **WebGL**: Fallback for broader compatibility
- **Canvas2D**: Compatibility mode for limited hardware
- **Hybrid**: Automatic selection based on content and performance

### Layout Algorithms

1. **Force-Directed**: Nodes repel, connected nodes attract (default)
2. **Hierarchical**: Tree-like structures for dependencies
3. **Circular**: Nodes arranged in circles around central hub
4. **Time-based**: Temporal organization (timeline view)
5. **Custom Physics**: User-configurable forces and constraints

### Configuration DSL

```kotlin
graphDesktop {
    enabled = true
    renderingEngine = RenderingEngine.WEBGPU
    enablePhysics = true
    enableGestures = true
    
    nodeType("application") {
        visual {
            useActualIcon = true
            glowOnActivity = true
            scaleWithImportance = true
        }
        behavior {
            doubleClickToLaunch = true
            enableContextMenu = true
        }
    }
    
    layout(LayoutAlgorithm.FORCE_DIRECTED) {
        nodeRepulsion = 100.0
        edgeAttraction = 50.0
        centeringForce = 0.1
        damping = 0.9
    }
    
    workspace("Project Work") {
        autoCluster = true
        showRelatedSuggestions = true
        timeBasedDepth = true
    }
}
```
