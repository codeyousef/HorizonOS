- ➡️ **NEXT**: Test compositor and add rendering integration

**Next Week**: 
- Test the compositor with real applications
- Integrate graph rendering into compositor
- Add AI-powered relationship discovery
- Implement workspace management
- Add XWayland support for legacy apps

## Performance Metrics
- **Rendering Performance**: Target 60fps with 1000+ nodes
  - Current: N/A (not implemented)
- **Memory Usage**: Target <2GB for typical workloads  
  - Current: N/A (not implemented)
- **Response Time**: Target <100ms for all interactions
  - Current: N/A (not implemented)

## Testing Status
- [ ] Unit tests for core components
- [ ] Integration tests for system compatibility
- [ ] Performance benchmarking suite
- [ ] User acceptance testing framework

## Known Issues & Blockers
- None yet (implementation not started)

## Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Rendering Engine**: Using wgpu-rs for WebGPU with OpenGL fallback
2. **Language Stack**: Rust for core engine, potential TypeScript for config UI
3. **Integration Strategy**: Native Wayland compositor using Smithay framework
4. **Configuration**: Leveraging existing Kotlin DSL system (fully implemented)
5. **AI Integration**: Local-first with Ollama for privacy
6. **Data Model**: Property graph model for flexibility
7. **Window Management**: Windows mapped directly to graph nodes
8. **Input Handling**: Compositor events routed through graph interaction system

## Key Milestones
- [ ] Milestone 1: Basic rendering with nodes and edges
- [ ] Milestone 2: Interactive graph navigation
- [ ] Milestone 3: File system integration
- [ ] Milestone 4: Application launching via graph
- [ ] Milestone 5: AI-powered organization
- [ ] Milestone 6: Full Hyprland integration
- [ ] Milestone 7: Production-ready release

## Notes
- Native Wayland compositor approach (not Hyprland plugin)
- Kotlin DSL already has comprehensive graph desktop configuration support
- Focus on gradual integration rather than complete replacement
- Priority on performance and usability from day one
- Key integration points identified between Kotlin DSL and Rust implementation
- Visual design system and clustering are highest priority missing features
